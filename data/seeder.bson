I was pleasantly surprised just how different the profile was and how complex it became, especially for Dickel distillate. It was a nice look into an atypical bourbon profile that I came to thoroughly enjoy. I wont likely go out and get a bottle of my own since its pretty pricey but it was a nice glimpse into new, unique profiles. For these reasons, Im rating this dram a 6. Its great and has no major flaws but was more of an adventure to me. I dont think Id take this over some other heavy hitters in the Rank 7 category on my shelf if I really had the choice - especially for the prices.",

It is really well done, though, and I will call it very good because it has quite an array of great notes - especially on the nose.

I like that it is sweet but it really fell flat on my expectations. If I could, Id slot this sucker into a \"budget barrel proof\" category. Feels rough and hot - lets half the price and be realistic about what youre getting. Its a little better than the average, I wouldnt turn it down if handed to me, but you can bet that if I saw the shimmer of a Bookers box within a square mile Id drop this in a flash in favor of that. For all of those reasons, I'm giving this dram a 6. A cut above but really it barely got here due to my love of caramel and malty sweet.

I'd also easily choose Buffalo Trace (my baseline) against this any day. Were in a day and age when what's in the bottle needs to stand up to other shelf competitors. Flashy packaging cant cover the flaws in this bottle, and the price it sits at is almost insulting. Campari, I know you can do better, even if you don't have to.

This is bottled at Elijah Craig's standard 47% ABV and I've been working through this bottle for a month or two now. Let's get to it.",

The palate feels a bit thin - surprising given how much oak emanates in each step of the tasting. This is better than Michter's efforts in my opinion, which gives me hope. I bet if Heaven Hill can dial this in a bit, they'll have a rockstar in their pocket, though there's work to do before they get there. It's a release to keep your eye on. I'm looking forward to comparing this release to future batches in an effort to hopefully see some big improvement.",

Selected by Master Sommelier George Miliotes, this is an interesting release, so I'm looking forward to giving it a go. Let's dive in.",
        "nose": "Strong vanilla, maple, honey and praline notes initially. Fruity, bright - not the standard MGP presence. Hooten suggests you may find notes of cream, apple, maple and vanilla, and the apple note is certainly prominent. Faint pine, some light oak character and a bit of brown sugar. Not mega complex, but what's there is pleasant and inviting.",

Pralines, slivered almonds, brown sugar and almost a faint rummy quality. On the sweet side, not a ton of oak for the age, but sweet and approachable.",
        "finish": "Much longer finish than expected. This is where things hit really nicely. Apple pie, some cherry, hint of molasses and tobacco. Still a bit light on structure, but the sweet notes hang in there with solid balance.",
        "overall": "An interesting dram for sure. It's sweeter, lighter in profile, and manages to hit some notes that I don't find in a whiskey too often. It reminds me of a cross between an apple pie and one of those decadent Amish shoo fly pies that's heavy on maple and brown sugar. I think a little more oak would give this great life, but it's really good as is. It's certainly not mundane, and I'll give it credit for that.",

This doesn't really seem to be an issue here. Sweet caramel candies, nice toffee, tobacco and pepper from the tannins. Rich red berry note that quickly gives way to vanilla bean and waffle cone. Not nearly as fruity as the Spring release of this year, the oak is definitely a more prominent guest in this show, but it works.",

The nose is borderline transcendent - easily the best part of enjoying this whiskey. We probably sat around and sniffed this for a solid 15 minutes before trying and it was well worth it. Its not that the palate and the finish disappoint but they just cant keep the momentum from the nose. It was rich overall and thoroughly enjoyable and as a result, Im going to give this bottle an ambiguous 7/8. Its on the line and I just cant decide. On one hand, its great whiskey. On the other though, its nothing like the hype. I dont feel the need to go buy one on the secondary, especially for what it commands. I especially dont think this can dominate over some other bottles in scotchland. For a $20 bottle, this is as good as it gets.

This dram sits with other bottles like Auchentoshan Triple Wood, Jim Beam White Label, Wieser Uuahouua and Journeyman Buggy Whip.

Again, I'm impressed and I certainly see the appeal now of hunting these fellas down. For the quality exhibited here, I'm giving the Old Grand Dad from 1998 a rating of a 6: a cut above. OGD1998 sits handily next to other classic BIBs in the bracket, sharing a row with the likes of Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond, Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond and Wild Turkey 101.",

        "overall": "Despite the tone my notes may give - this isn't a bad product. I enjoyed it, but wasn't blown away. Its unique, though, and gives a little different feel than most oak or spice driven bourbons. It's light, doughy, fruity, sweet - everything a wheater typically is. That being said, it wasn't impressive. It wasn't really exciting. It was almost too delicate - the thin mouthfeel for a 100pf product was sort of a letdown. I won't hesitate to say I like this much better than Makers Mark but if you offered me this and a dram of Buffalo Trace, it wouldn't be an easy decision. I don't take price into my ranking, but for a product that is double or more at the register, I'm not so sure that's a great impression to have been left with.",

One thing I'm noticing about these is their great ability to integrate sweet creamy notes with peppery spices and the oak. One downside though is that the oak often lashes out in the finish. This one seems to balance pretty well without becoming a bitter bomb, but its definitely there.",

The more I try these bourbons from Smooth Ambler, the more I realize that MGP bourbon just isn't my jam like their rye is. I like this a lot more than a lot of 10yr SiB products so I don't doubt this was well picked but overall I just don't think the base spirit is for me. I'm rating this dram a 6 - its good but nothing exceptional. Overall, I think I set my internal expectations far too high but that's just how the donut rolls sometimes. Thanks for reading!",

I cant say that it is phenomenal, or worth close to even half of its secondary value but I did enjoy it. To me, it was on par with a good ER10 store pick - quality wise. Im going to give this a Rank 6 as a result.",

It's sweeter than it's spicy, the wood character is mostly sweet and desserty, then the back palate strikes. Spicy and dark, like rye bread.",

You could easily flip this release to an experimental one off, and have put RR13 in the Masters Keep seat, and probably have found it feeling more natural.",

This was revealed to me to be a Woodford Reserve Selection, but an interesting one. A blend of two barrels, released by Rays Wine and Spirits in Wisconsin. The banana note makes a lot more sense now, and I'm a little peeved I couldn't find it in me to place it, but what can ya do. Pretty much nailed the rest, so I feel alright given the age and the ABV.",
