Feels rough and hot - lets half the price and be realistic about what youre getting. Its a little better than the average, I wouldnt turn it down if handed to me, but you can bet that if I saw the shimmer of a Bookers box within a square mile Id drop this in a flash in favor of that. For all of those reasons, I'm giving this dram a 6. A cut above but really it barely got here due to my love of caramel and malty sweet.

What shows up, however, is a delightful fruit bowl of character, a rich chewy mouth feel and the perfect amount of oak. Holding in line with sensible value ($10/yr ish) it's hard not to remark on the value as well, but with $ not factored into ratings here, it's pure tastiness is enough to leave it standing on its own.",

				"taste":   "Thin with some heat. At 50% though, some heat is almost certainly present - although I was hoping for a little more richness. Sweet cocoa, cracked black pepper, some cloves. Not much sweetness from the nose is present here - its definitely spice heavy.",
				"finish":  "Short, with some odd young funk, and a bit of heat. Peppery clove, allspice and faint sweetness are present.",
				"overall": "Overall, this is fairly disappointing. Enjoying this over the course of the bottle, not a lot changed. I hoped the youthful notes would go away, but they remained. I hoped some sweetness would develop to offset the heat and spice - that didn't happen. It's not terrible whiskey, but Id take 101 over this any day. I'd also easily choose Buffalo Trace (my baseline) against this any day. Were in a day and age when what's in the bottle needs to stand up to other shelf competitors. Flashy packaging cant cover the flaws in this bottle, and the price it sits at is almost insulting. Campari, I know you can do better, even if you don't have to. I know this bottle basically sells itself thanks to your marketing giant, but you haven't won over this guy. Stick to letting the Russell's do what they do best - make great product.",

				"taste":   "Medium mouth feel - heat very much in check, though. Sweet cream, toffee, cocoa, vanilla bean and apple butter. Cinnamon, light nutmeg. Oak structure is dead on, clove grows a little with time.",
				"finish":  "Long, not as complex in the finish, but lots of notes I really like here: creamy vanilla bean, toffee, just the right amount of oak. Caramel and graham cracker crust.",
				"overall": "This is a great selection by bourbon street. I'd consider it off profile for ER10, which I routinely find to be a detriment, but this is right on the money. That savory, sweet apple pie character is not something I usually get in Eagle Rare, but it's welcome and well integrated on this one.",

				"overall": "Overall, this is V1 of a new product. I think it's a good start, but there's work to do. The nose is really very nice. The palate feels a bit thin - surprising given how much oak emanates in each step of the tasting. This is better than Michter's efforts in my opinion, which gives me hope. I bet if Heaven Hill can dial this in a bit, they'll have a rockstar in their pocket, though there's work to do before they get there. It's a release to keep your eye on. I'm looking forward to comparing this release to future batches in an effort to hopefully see some big improvement.",

Certainly not overbearing (a surprise, for sure) the pepper takes a back seat. Unfortunately, instead of revealing a marvelous, complex whiskey, the young Dickel notes come on strong: young grainy texture, some malty cardboard, honey, toffee and bold pepper and chiles.",
				"finish":  "Short finish, a bit more pepper forward here than anywhere else and a relief to help cover up the base spirit.",
				"overall": "Initially I thought the pepper would be too strong, but overall, I think it could be stronger. Or at least until better base whiskey goes into the experiment. That said, it's not surprising that Dickel didn't put their best, aged, stock into such a wacky idea, but the lack of quality is apparent for sure. It's certainly not terrible, but could use work. In the meantime, polish off your bottle in a whiskey Bloody Mary, and you'll be just fine.",

But regardless, I sought out to find a bottle. While this doesn't quite live up to my intoxicated opinion, it's still really quite good. The wine finish does great things to the young whiskey without covering up the flavor profile. I think it's an alright, if educational, bottle all in all.",

I didnt mind sipping this neat but this really seems to sit in cocktail territory for me. It doesnt do any one thing very well and the all over the place flavor, astringency and herbal bitterness leave me less than thrilled to drink a whole bottle of it. Then comes the price. $60ish? No thank you. I see this as something to liven up a cocktail but I couldnt justify the price for the purpose. For this reason, Im giving this dram a 4 - theres some flaws to overcome but it isnt wretched. Im still curious on the others though. Im going to do what I can to get my paws on some other finishes for Rendezvous Rye, Double Rye and now American Prairie. Gotta try em all!",

Selected by Master Sommelier George Miliotes, this is an interesting release, so I'm looking forward to giving it a go. Let's dive in.",

Not mega complex, but what's there is pleasant and inviting.",

Pralines, slivered almonds, brown sugar and almost a faint rummy quality. On the sweet side, not a ton of oak for the age, but sweet and approachable.",

It reminds me of a cross between an apple pie and one of those decadent Amish shoo fly pies that's heavy on maple and brown sugar. I think a little more oak would give this great life, but it's really good as is. It's certainly not mundane, and I'll give it credit for that.",

				"intro":   "Maker's Mark, one of the larger producers of bourbon in Kentucky, produces wheated bourbon that is sold both domestically and abroad. Until recent years, Maker's only produced a small handful of products. In the last couple of years, though, products like Maker's Mark 46 and Maker's Mark Cask Strength have seen domestic releases.

A hint of berry, then the oak makes an appearance. I always have concerns with bourbon 12+ years or so - that perhaps too much oak will turn great flavor into a bitter bomb. This doesn't really seem to be an issue here. Sweet caramel candies, nice toffee, tobacco and pepper from the tannins. Rich red berry note that quickly gives way to vanilla bean and waffle cone. Not nearly as fruity as the Spring release of this year, the oak is definitely a more prominent guest in this show, but it works.",

This is the first 8yr age stated bottling in this series, and is comprised of barrels pulled from 3 different Rickhouses on two different production dates.",

				"taste":   "Rich on the palate. Almost a nuttiness to it - and a touch of banana. Light red berries, then it’s all dessert. Nougat, brown sugar, toffee, cake batter, black walnut and creme brûlée.",
				"finish":  "Long finish. Not quite as complex as previous year’s finishes, but there’s a bit to dig through all the same. Mostly sweet and dessert forward, this bottling reminds me of a pecan pie with a maple glaze. The youth and vibrancy is more on display here, and it works.",
				"overall": "This years release is a different beast compared to much more tannin driven bottlings that have come before it, and I’m a fan of the shift in profile. If you’re hunting for that monstrous oak structure, you’ll want to leave this to other hunters, but if dessert and maple are your friends, this is the ideal drinker.",

Sweet and syrupy, leaning hard into butterscotch, cherry pie and a really nice faint cocoa presence. Oak structure is present and keeps the sweetness in check. Rich overall.",

This, however, is rich and complex, hitting notes that tell me this was dumped at just the right age. On the sweet side, with the right amount of oak, I'm a fan. Heaven Hill sent me a media sample to try, and I went and got one for myself, a real rarity if you're familiar with my buying habits, and that probably tells you all you need to know.",

The nose is borderline transcendent - easily the best part of enjoying this whiskey. We probably sat around and sniffed this for a solid 15 minutes before trying and it was well worth it. Its not that the palate and the finish disappoint but they just cant keep the momentum from the nose. It was rich overall and thoroughly enjoyable and as a result, Im going to give this bottle an ambiguous 7/8. Its on the line and I just cant decide. On one hand, its great whiskey. On the other though, its nothing like the hype. I dont feel the need to go buy one on the secondary, especially for what it commands. I especially dont think this can dominate over some other bottles in scotchland. For a $20 bottle, this is as good as it gets. When competing with modern offerings all over the price spectrum, the competition gets fierce.",

This dram sits with other bottles like Auchentoshan Triple Wood, Jim Beam White Label, Wieser Uuahouua and Journeyman Buggy Whip.

Price tag and rarity alone, this much oak is overbearing and manages to sap enjoyment from the notes I do really like by accentuating a bitter oak note that I don't love. A bummer, but I'll happily take the 15 year in favor any day. Bourbon is in a weird place where it's probably preposterous to designate one hyper expensive hyper rare bourbon better than another hyper rare hyper expensive bourbon in preference since neither can truly be easily found, but for a solid yard stick...a good single barrel of Buffalo Trace will top this without much trouble.",

I'm not sure which one I favor more in the old vs new debate (I wish I had a way to SBS them) but the new doesn't seem to have dipped in quality and they're both delicious. For this, I'm rating the dusty Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond a 6 - placing it among other \"step above\" drams like modern VOB BiB, Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond 6yr, Colonel EH Taylor Small Batch and Smooth Ambler Old Scout 10yr Bourbon.

				"intro":   "Wild Turkey 101 is about as ubiquitous a whiskey that has ever existed - and that's for the better. Moderately aged, aggressively priced, and proofed well at 50.5% ABV, the legacy of what some refer to as the 'Mighty Gobble' is a whiskey known for neat drinking, bar shots and cocktails alike. Let's dive in and see how it rates.",
				"nose":    "Vanilla, cinnamon and a faint hint of alcohol. For what Im guessing is a moderately aged bourbon, the nose holds up very well. Also, very well blended for a healthy 101 proof. Mouthfeel is just right, with plenty of flavors.",
				"taste":   "The cinnamon is there and overtakes the vanilla. Less sweetness than the nose would lead one to believe and a bit more burn. Its not particularly complex, but boy is it good.",
				"finish":  "Short and a bit harsh, but well blended. You can tell this is a 101 proof dram, but its not punishing.",

				"overall": "Overall, this performs nicely. The addition of further maturation shows clearly through the bold tannin structure, especially in the finish. The palate has quite a bit going on, and shows up with a satisfyingly silky texture. The finish is a bit dry for me, but this will be a huge hit for those who prefer, sweet and dry, tannic bourbons.",

				"intro":   "Distilled by Woodford Reserve and bottled at barrel proof, this release clocks in at 59.9% ABV and continues the use of Woodford's newest bottle design for limited edition releases in the Master's Collection. It's worth noting here that the barrel proof designation is an assumption - the bottle is labeled 'Batch Proof' which is an interesting moniker of a term, but with a unique ABV that's quite high for the brand, it's likely barrel proof. These can be found with some rolling availability in the United States, and should retail around $110.",
				"nose":    "Rich and fragrant, loaded with maple, tobacco, rich tannin, and a creamy sweetness. Caramel candies, butterscotch, pralines and a touch of ethanol.",
				"taste":   "Rich and viscous on the palate. Big maple notes, tons of tobacco, root beer candies and creamy vanilla bean. It's all dessert, all day, and with a strong oaky backbone, it's perfectly balanced.",
				"finish":  "Long, spicy finish. A bit of ethanol here, the proof rears its head most, but still not with a fire. Rich, complex, maple candy and root beer and cola dominate with a touch of tobacco.",
				"overall": "Fantastic batch proof, perhaps the best tasted in a while. Hats off to Woodford for this one. It's often hard to justify the prices on these, but in this case, it's warranted. The complexity here is well beyond Woodford's standard expressions, to paint a delightfully maple and cola forward barrel proof expression.",
